# Algorithm - as of what I understood
1. START
2. DEFINE SOLUTION SPACE
3. REPEAT N TIMES<br>
3.1 INITIALIZE POPULATION <br>
3.2 EVALUATE FITNESS AND RANK POPULATION<br>
3.3 REPRODUCE SEEDS BASED ON RANK OF POPULATION<br>
3.4 DISPERSE NEW SEEDS OVER SOLUTION SPACE<br>
3.5 EVALUATE FITNESS AND RANK POPULATION FOR NEW WEEDS<br>
3.6 IF NUMBER OF WEEDS > some threshold <br>
    - Then ELIMINATE WEEDS WITH LOWER FITNESS
4. WEED WITH THE BEST FITNESS IS SOLUTION
