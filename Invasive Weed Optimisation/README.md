# Algorithm - what I understood from different papers
1. Start
2. Define solution space
3. Repeat N Times<br>
3.1 *Initialize* Population <br>
3.2 *Evaluate* Fitness and Rank population<br>
3.3 *Reproduce* seeds based on rank of population<br>
3.4 *Disperse* new seeds over the solution space<br>
3.5 *Evaluate* Fitness and Rank population for new Weeds<br>
3.6 If the number of Weeds > some threshold <br>
    - Then *Eliminate* the Weeds with lower fitness
4. Weed with the best fitness is the final solution

The initial steps are similar to a GA implementation, a possible system solution is known as weed and the weed population is randomly created and then evaluated.
The members of the population are allowed to leave a n seeds (S) depending on their own and on the highest and lowest population fitness as described by

Spreading operator explores the search space, dispersion one exploits the weed location, and the rolling-down combines these methods to improve the actual solution. Altogether the invasive-weed operators permit a rapid exploration and exploitation of the search space. 

In addition, mutation-based operators create new settings instead of performing crossover operations, requiring less computational effort.
